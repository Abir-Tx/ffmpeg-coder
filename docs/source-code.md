## Main source code holding DIRs

As you can see there are many folders in the project. Not all are needed for our source code. The main folders you should look in are 

- **include/ffmpeg-coder:** This dir holds all the main source code for ffmpeg-coder (writen from scratch)
- **lib:** This folder holds all the third party libraries used in this project
- **src:** This is folder holding the ***main*** block of the tool. More precisely all the ```.cpp``` files are stored here.
